# Quick Sort vs Bubble Sort Performance Comparison

This project is a comparative analysis of two sorting algorithms, **Quick Sort** and **Bubble Sort**, 
based on their performance when applied to different types of lists. The goal is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of 
each algorithm using four test cases: small and large random lists, and small and large sorted lists.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze how Quick Sort and Bubble Sort perform on the following lists:

- **Small Random List**: A list of random numbers with a small size.
- **Large Random List**: A list of random numbers with a large size.
- **Small Sorted List**: A small list that is already sorted.
- **Large Sorted List**: A large list that is already sorted.

### Sorting Algorithms

1. **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' and partitions the list into elements less than and greater than the pivot, recursively sorting the sub-lists.
   
2. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, and repeats until the list is sorted.

### Performance Metrics

number of steps needed to complete the sorting.
